#+title: README

The configuration, written in a literate programming approach, was
used on a daily basis on Ubuntu 20.04, Arch Linux and occasionally on
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. With dependencies met, it's supposed to functional
properly with branch =native-comp=.

For various reasons, I decided to migrate to a non-literate config,
which is now located at https://github.com/ljg16654/.emacs.d.
